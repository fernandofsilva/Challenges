# Challenges

This repository contains the code used in the Data Science challenges

## Quickstart

To run each code, it is necessary to check the libraries used in the
challenges, the repository is not aiming to provide full suport in each code,
the codes are just references if you are facing the same challenges, use
the codes by you own.
